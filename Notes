* Add the ability to upload SSH keys
* Check $value === htmlspecialchars($value) everywhere in php and fail if not
* static ip
* documentation in MD
* dump dead code in common.php
* add memory and cpu status to index.html
* In dsas.js lots of duplicate code in the *_error function could easily rationalize
  this code
* Don't allow certificates to be deleted if a task that depends on them exists
* Backup the two /mnt/sda1/tce/mydata.tgz files as a means of keeping the 
  configuration
* FIXME permissions of mydata.tgz file !! readable/modifiable by user tc and  
  group staff ok. But shouldn't be readbaable by everyone
* Use JS "fetch" etc in dsas.js and eliminate completely JQUERY
* In common.php add more tests to complexity_test (LUDS?). Longer passwords ?
* Make the network 192.168.192.0/24 between the two machine configurable. 
  Danger, changing it and having a synchronisation problem will probably
  cut all communications between the two servers. So need to be really careful.
  Currently hardcoded in dsas service et common.php only
* Add htaccess to repo and the ability to set the password (username?) of 
  the access
* Should "filetool.sh -b" be run periodically for the backups ? dsas_conf.xml 
  be excluded in that case, so that a reboot before an apply can recover the
  xml from the backup ?
